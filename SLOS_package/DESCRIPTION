Description: Provides tools for predicting ICU length of stay and assessing ICU efficiency. 
  It is based on the methodologies proposed by Peres et al. (2022, 2023), which utilize data-driven approaches for modeling and validation, offering insights into ICU performance and patient outcomes. References: Peres et al. (2022)<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35988701/>, Peres et al. (2023)<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37922007/>.
